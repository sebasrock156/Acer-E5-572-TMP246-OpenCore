Here's a ULTRA WIP EFI Boot.

Works (for now):
- Opencore 0.9.0 (HFS Partitions now is show)
- Installer Boot (installation is a less of 35 minutes with SSD)
- USB Devices (2.0, 3.0/3.1)
- Audio Card (fully working)
- Screen

Not works (for now):
- System Boot (I think is for SMBIOS incompatibility)
- Touchpad (fault of kexts)
