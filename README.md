**Firstly we will go the base hardware for those EFIs needs to work**:
---

Hardware | Model

**Now, some minimum hardware recommendations**:

---

Hardware | Model
--- |:--:
RAM | Any Samsung, Hynix or Kingston DDR3 8GB(4GBx2).
Audio Card | Any Realtek Audio Card (some Broadcom cards may not work).
WLAN Card | Any Intel network card (A few Realtek cards works externally or a recommend Broadcom Apple supported card).
SATA Drive	| Any Solid State Drive (SSD) with 240GB of storage.
IDE Drive | Add a caddy for SATA Output, then, I recommend any Hard Disk with 500GB/1000GB of storage.

</details>

## Misc:
Some additional drivers and SSDTs are imported from Dell, Samsung, HP, Acer and Lenovo i7 5500U EFI Laptops, some native properties may be broken (like touchpad, keyboard shortcuts or card readers), I don't make responsible if your laptop explode later to try Hackintosh.
