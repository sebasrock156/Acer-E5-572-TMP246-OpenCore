Here's a WIP EFI Boot.

Works (for now):
- Opencore 0.9.2
- Installer Boot (installation is a less of 35 minutes with SSD)
- System Boot (It's fixed disabling SecureBootModel from config.plist)
- Ethernet
- USB Devices (2.0, 3.0/3.1)
- Audio Card (fully working; but isn't enabled)
- Screen (1366x768)
- Wi-Fi (altrough is some slow to connect)

Not works (for now):
- Touchpad (VoodooPS2Controller doesn't work full on Ventura; DON'T TRY TO USE, may break keyboard function)
- Bluetooth (I'll trying to fix it).
- Graphics (seen 4MB of Memory for HD 5500 incompatibility)
