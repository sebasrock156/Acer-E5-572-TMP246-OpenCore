# Acer TravelMate P246-MG Hackintosh OpenCore (Monterey 12.x)

The first pre-release is available on **RELEASE** section.

How works (for now):
- Opencore Bootloader (0.8.0)
- Installation (in my case, with the 12.6 latest Olarila version).
- Ethernet RJ45 Port
- Intel HD Graphics 5500 (patched in system as HD 6000)
- Touchpad (fully work)
- USB 2.0 and maybe USB 3.0/3.1
- SATA and IDE Drives
- Wireless Card (at least Intel)
