**Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**: My hardware is inherited from Aspire E5-471G model, this EFI works with Aspire V3-472G and some Aspire E5-573G models too (anyways, I'll wanna name "E5-471MG" üòÇüòÇüòÇ).

iGPU| Intel HD Graphics 5500
Audio Card | Realtek ALC283
dGPU | NVIDIA GeForce 820M (Not supported on MacOS)
WLAN Card | Intel Dual Band AC 3160 (From E5-471G)

**Now, some minimum hardware recommendations**:

---

Hardware | Model
--- |:--:
RAM | Any Samsung, Hynix or Kingston DDR3 8GB(4GBx2).
Audio Card | Any Realtek Audio Card (some Broadcom cards may not work).
WLAN Card | Any Intel network card (A few Realtek cards works externally; Intel supported cards is listed below).

## Installation Method:
<details>

**Before to try it**:

Maybe you need a External Keyboard and Mouse for use, and evite use USB 3.0/3.1 for Bootable USB Drive.

1. Using any macOS BigSur/Monterey/Ventura Image based on Olarila project and Balena Ecther for doing Booteable USB Drive.

2. If macOS image won't boot, mount Booteable USB Drive ESP (EFI) partition with ESP Mounter Pro or Clover/OpenCore Configurator (MacOS) or MiniTool Partition (Windows) and replace EFI Folder with THIS repo EFI Folder.

3. Boot to USB Drive always with BIOS Secure Boot ENABLED (if you disable Secure Boot, MacOS Preinstalled on Hard Drive/Solid Drive never will boot, stuck on Apple logo; rarely boots with Secure Boot disabled). 

## Post-InstallationÔºö
 **WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è** : If you wanna have Dualboot with Windows or Linux, Touchpad may be don't work, OpenCore EFI modify some ACPI values (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, a.k.a. memory access & Power from BIOS/Chipset to peripherics and motherboard components) and Touchpad (Synaptics or Elantech) crash with these modifies.

1. Mount the macOS Drive EFI Partition (with ESP Mounter Pro), later, drag EFI Folder from Booteable USB Drive and reboot.

2. Now, when you boot from your macOS Drive, go to Extras folder and run "GenSMBIOS.command", select option 2 for select included config.plist, after, select option 3 for generate a new Apple SMBIOS and Serial. This is for fix not working Apple ID and Apple Aplications.

</details>

## Applications Support:

**Warning**: Some Apple apps as iMessage, FaceTime, App Store, Apple Music and etc won't login although you have patched SMBIOS before, you need an Apple product serial compatible with Apple Support too, consult in Olarila how fix it.
